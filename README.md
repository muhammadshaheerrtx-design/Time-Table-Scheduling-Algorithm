# Time-Table-Scheduling-Algorithm
GreedyScheduler is a modern, high-performance University Timetable Generator and Interactive Simulator. Built with a responsive PyQt6 dark-mode interface, it uses an advanced Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) backend to automatically schedule complex university constraints—including multi-slot labs, instructor availability, student sections, and room capacities—without creating collisions.

It also includes a powerful Interactive Rescheduling Engine, allowing administrators to manually drag, drop, and force-move classes using a visual heat-map that perfectly tracks instructor and student availability in real-time.

✨ Features
Smart Constraint Engine: Automatically resolves clashes between teachers, rooms, and sections. Treats lab courses as contiguous multi-hour blocks.
"Friday Free" Mode: An aggressive optimization mode that attempts to compress the university schedule into Monday–Thursday, leaving Fridays as free as possible.
Interactive Heat-Map Rescheduling: Right-click any course to enter "Reschedule Mode". The grid instantly highlights available, collision-free slots in Green, and blocked slots in Red.
Real-Time Collision Feedback: Hovering over a blocked slot tells you exactly why it failed (e.g., "Teacher Clash", "Section Clash", or "All Rooms Occupied").
Multi-Perspective Views: Filter the generated timetable by Section, Building, or Teacher.
Universal Search: Instantly filter courses via the live search bar by course code, title, room, or instructor name.
Export Capabilities: Export the finalized timetables directly to PDF or Excel (.xlsx) formats.
🚀 Installation
Ensure you have Python 3.9+ installed.

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/MuhammadBinWaseemm/GreedyScheduler.git
cd GreedyScheduler
Install the required dependencies:

pip install PyQt6 pandas openpyxl reportlab
🎮 How to Use the Simulator
Launch the Application: Run the main GUI file to start the simulator.

python gui.py
Import Data:

Click the "📂 Courses" button and select your master courses Excel file.
Click the "📂 Rooms" button and select your master rooms Excel file.
Generate Timetable:

Click "📅 Generate Timetable" to run the standard CSP solver.
Alternatively, click "🏖️ Friday Free" to instruct the solver to prioritize a 4-day workweek.
Navigate Views:

Use the View Section, View Building, or View Teacher buttons on the sidebar to change perspectives.
Use the dropdown menu at the top to select specific target groups.
Interactive Rescheduling (Manual Overrides):

In any view, Right-Click a scheduled course and select "Reschedule this class".
The grid will turn into a heat-map.
Green Slots are safe. Right-click a green slot to pick an available room and confirm the move.
Red Slots have a clash. If you must force a collision, right-click the red slot, and the system will explicitly warn you of the consequences before allowing the override.
Changing the dropdown filter or typing in the search bar will automatically cancel Reschedule Mode for safety.
Exporting:

Once satisfied, use the "📄 Export PDF" or "📊 Export Excel" buttons to save the master timetables to your machine.
📁 Required Excel Formats
To ensure the engine parses your data correctly, your Excel files should follow these formats:

Courses Excel (Expected Columns):

Course Code (e.g., CS101. Labs must end in 'L', e.g., CS101L)
Course Title
Credit Hours (Labs should be 1 credit hour = 3 time slots)
Section (Comma-separated if combined, e.g., "BCS-2A, BCS-2B")
Instructor (Comma-separated for co-teachers)
Type (Core / Elective)
Rooms Excel (Expected Columns):

# (Index)
Building (e.g., AcB, FCSE)
Room Name (e.g., LH1, Lab 2)
Type (Lecture or Lab)
🛠️ Architecture
gui.py: The PyQt6 interactive frontend and manual rescheduling logic.
scheduler_engine.py: The core CSP / Min-Conflicts solver algorithm.
integrator.py: The bridge that passes GUI commands and file paths to the solver.
excel_parser.py: Handles data ingestion and strict data cleaning using pandas.
export_manager.py: Handles formatting and layout generation for PDF/Excel exports.
